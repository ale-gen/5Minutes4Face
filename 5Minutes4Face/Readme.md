Hi :wave: 

This project is still in progress :muscle: !

It is created to make life easier for companies, which organize some events for children, like inflatable castles. Enjoying of the play should contains time slots to enable all childrens to benefit from the attraction. Thanks to this app you can only take photo of child, set the time and don't worry that you are not able to recognise which child's time times up!
